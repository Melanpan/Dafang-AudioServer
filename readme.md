A very basic audio server based on the audioplay example code, for the Dafang 128MB V2 running CFW (https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks)

It listens on port 9000 and accepts 16bit 8Khz audio, you can set the volume as argument from 0 to 100, defaults to 50. Which means you can send as much PCM data to it and it will happily play it.

To compile it, take a look at https://github.com/Dafang-Hacks/Main/blob/master/Readme.md
and the MakeFile that's included with this.


I've included my own compiled binary.
